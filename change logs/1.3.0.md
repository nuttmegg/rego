# The Cleaner Update ‚ú® üç≤
### Stews v1.3.0
holy fuck this has been a big and very annoying update to make like so big and annoying I started it like a week ago<br>
here are the new changes additions and new things that are coming in the stews 1.3.0 update<br><br>

### Cleaner Fetching
Now instead of having to use fetch() you can use these!<br>
also fetch() still exists but this is cool;
```js
let list = new Stew( ["a", "b", "c", "d"] );
let pair = new Stew( {"key": "value", "other key": "other value"} );

list[0]; // "a"
list['a']; // "a"
list.a; // "a"

pair[0]; // "value"
pair['key']; // "value"
pair.key; // "value"
```
<br>

### Cleaner Setting
Now instead of having to use set() you can just do it the old fashioned way!
```js
let list = new Stew( ["e", "b", "f", "d"] );
let pair = new Stew( {"key": "value5", "key2": "other OTHER value"} );

list[0] = "a";
list.f = "c";

// ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

pair[0] = "value";
pair.key2 = "other value";

// {key: "value", key2: "other value"}
```
<br>

### Cleaner Deleting
Now instead of having to use delete() you can just do it once again the old fashioned way!
```js
let list = new Stew( ["a", "e", "b", "f", "c"] );
let pair = new Stew( {"key": "value", "key2": "other value", "key3": "other OTHER value"} );

delete list[1];
delete list.f;

// ["a", "b", "c"]

delete pair[1];
delete pair.key3;

// {key: "value"}
```

### KeyOf, ValueOf, and EntryOf Functions!
Now instead of just indexOf there is keyOf, valueOf, and entryOf for you to use!
<br><br>

### Front and Back Functions!
> #### Front
> gets the first entry in a stew/soup<br>
> Alias first()

> #### Back
> gets the last entry in a stew/soup<br>
> Alias last()

<br>

### Updated documentation
The new documentation should be fully up to date for 1.3.0 if you want to see it go [here](https://github.com/nuttmegg/stews/wiki)
<br><br>

### Misc
- Updated filter() and similar functions to have key, value, and index parameters instead of just stuff
- Added rename() which lets you rename a key. `Stew/Soup.rename(<old>, <new>);`
- Changed types to be only list and pair so they can be made faster
- Updated stringify() to work with lists
- Removed parse() bc it's stupid
- Added isStew() and isSoup()
- NUMEROUS bug fixes and stupid changes
