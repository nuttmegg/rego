# The Strings and Sorts Update! üßµ üç≤
### Stews v1.2.0
- Removed brew() for soups and stews and replaced it with [pour()](https://github.com/nuttmegg/stews/wiki/Getting-Information#pour-list-and-pair) to avoid confusion with the new brew function
- Added support for strings so that you don't have to manually split them
- Added [sort()](https://github.com/nuttmegg/stews/wiki/Using-Information#sorting)
- Added [reverse()](https://github.com/nuttmegg/stews/wiki/Using-Information#reversing)
- Replaced the main sort() with [swig()](https://github.com/nuttmegg/stews/wiki/Using-Information#swigging) and made sort() an alias
- Added new [brew()](https://github.com/nuttmegg/stews/wiki/Creating-Stews-&-Soups#brewing) function
- Added a new way to create new stews/soups with a certain type:
```js
// turns into an object/map
new Stew(Object)
new Stew(Map)

// turns into an array/set
new Stew(String)
new Stew(Array)
new Stew(Set)

// depends on what type the stew/soup is
new Stew(Stew)
new Stew(Soup)
```
